# LapTimer

The lap timer we have set up right now is a very good set up, but there are some improvments that can be made. The packaging of the system needs to be improved. It is gator cliped together and is kind of a mess. I would like to integrate it into one case to hold a lot of the stuff. The sensors are hot glued on the pvc and 2x4. I would like to change the sensor stand. Because god forbid someone hit the sensor with the car those 2x4 are going to do some serious damage. I have not come up with a good idea on how I want to go about getting the data from the lap timer. I have thought to have the arduino record the lap times to file on a SD card, but we will want to see the times in real time. The Yun that we are using now has wifi cabablities and we can then have it serial.print and connect to it wirelessly or wired with a usb. But then we will always need a laptop and that is a pain becuase a laptop will not last a 8am to 7pm test day. We can make a display and that may work really well with a batter in that. We always have car 12v batteries that we can power the display with. Lastly I would like to add a third sensor to do more split times on larger tracks. 

The sensors are from Automation Direct.
